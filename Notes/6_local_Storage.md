# Why Store User Info in LocalStorage During Sign-Up?

Storing user information in `localStorage` during sign-up is useful for:

1. **Persistent data**: User data remains available even after the page is refreshed or the browser is closed.
2. **Session management**: You can keep the user signed in by storing authentication tokens or user details.
3. **Quick access**: Information like username, theme preferences, or user settings can be fetched quickly without additional API calls.

However, sensitive information (like passwords) should not be stored in `localStorage` due to security concerns; use secure tokens like JWT instead.



# Note: 
`localStorage` can only store data as strings. When you pass an object (like `data`), it needs to be converted into a string format using `JSON.stringify()` so that it can be stored. If you store it without converting, you'll lose the structure of the object. Later, when retrieving the data, you can convert it back into an object using `JSON.parse()`.
