**Context in React**:  
Context is a way to share data between components without passing props through every level of the tree. Itâ€™s useful for managing global states like themes or user authentication across the app.

**Zustand**:  
Zustand is a simple and lightweight state management library for React. It uses hooks and is easier to set up than Redux, with minimal boilerplate. It focuses on simplicity, providing a fast, flexible way to manage state.

**Redux**:  
Redux is a popular state management library that provides a centralized store for managing the global state of your app. It is more powerful but requires more setup and has more boilerplate code compared to Zustand.

**Which is better?**  
If you need a simple, lightweight solution with less setup, **Zustand** is better.  
If you need a more powerful, structured solution for large-scale apps, **Redux** might be a better fit.
