In this code, `useRef` is used to create a reference to the last message element in the list, allowing you to scroll to that element when new messages are rendered.

### Explanation of `useRef`

- `useRef` is a React hook that creates a **mutable object** whose `.current` property persists across re-renders.
- In this case, `lastMessageRef` is intended to refer to the last message element, which enables smooth scrolling to this message whenever the component renders.



   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
     lastMessageRef.current?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth" });
   }, [messages]);
   ```

2. **Position of `ref` in the Map Loop**:  
   Currently, `ref={lastMessageRef}` is added to every `message` in the `map` loop. This means each message will refer to `lastMessageRef`, and only the last one should have the intended effect. But sometimes, React might not update `lastMessageRef` consistently if every element in the list uses the same `ref`. Ensure `ref` is assigned only to the last message by changing the code to:

   ```javascript
   {messages.map((message, index) => (
     <div
       key={message._id}
       ref={lastMessageRef}
     >
       <Message message={message} />
     </div>
   ))}
   ```

After these adjustments, `lastMessageRef` should refer to the last message in `messages`, and `scrollIntoView` should execute each time `messages` updates, enabling smooth scrolling.
