These numbers are called **HTTP status codes**. They are used by web servers to indicate the status of a client's request. Each status code is a 3-digit number and belongs to one of the five categories:

1. **1xx - Informational**:
   - 100: Continue
   - 101: Switching Protocols
   - 102: Processing

2. **2xx - Success**: The request was successful.
   - **200**: OK (The request was successful.)
   - 201: Created
   - 202: Accepted
   - 204: No Content

3. **3xx - Redirection**: Further action is needed to complete the request.
   - 301: Moved Permanently
   - 302: Found (Temporary Redirect)
   - 304: Not Modified

4. **4xx - Client Error**: The client made a mistake in the request.
   - **400**: Bad Request (The server could not understand the request.)
   - **401**: Unauthorized (Authentication required or failed.)
   - 403: Forbidden (Client does not have permission.)
   - **404**: Not Found (The requested resource could not be found.)

5. **5xx - Server Error**: The server failed to full fill a valid request.
   - **500**: Internal Server Error (A generic error when the server fails.)
   - 502: Bad Gateway
   - 503: Service Unavailable

These codes help the client understand the result of their request and how to proceed.
